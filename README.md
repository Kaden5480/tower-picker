# tower-picker
A quick program I wrote to pick random towers to complete in more configurable ways.

# rules.py
Copy `src/rules.py.example` to `src/rules.py` and then configure it as needed.

# Tower file location

> [!NOTE]
> I changed the name of Garden of Eeshöl so it included the `ö` symbol

# Completions
Literally just copied and pasted from the completed towers section on
